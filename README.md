## Hi there 👋,

my name is Dmytro. I'm a passionate software developer and technologies enthusiast. 

My professional journey started in 2011 and it keeps moving. I was doing a lot of engineering for mobile operating systems. 

In 2020 I switched to backend development and fall in love with Ruby on Rails, Python and cloud computing.
